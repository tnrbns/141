# CMSC 141 - Introduction to Theory of Automata and Computation
Some machine problems I've done for CMSC 141 - Introduction to Theory of Automata and Computation for second semester, SY 2021-2022

## List of MPs
3. _Smiling is Not a Regular Expression_ - Given a valid regular expression, check if strings the user inputs are valid.
4. *Grammar Nazi 2.0* - Another implementation of a previous machine problem using deterministic finite automata. Given a C variable or function declaration, check if it is valid.
