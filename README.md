# CMSC 141 - Introduction to Theory of Automata and Computation
Some machine problems I've done for CMSC 141 - Introduction to Theory of Automata and Computation for second semester, SY 2021-2022

## List of MPs
3. _Smiling is not a regular expression_ - Given a valid regular expression, check if strings the user inputs are valid.
4. *Grammar Nazi 2.0* - Another implementation of previous machine problem, but using deterministic finite automata.
